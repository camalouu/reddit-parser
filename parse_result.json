There's something very insecure and off-putting about anyone misusing or overusing these expressions.","): I consistently have \"hahahahahahaha\" in most of my texts and I leave it alone when it autocorrects to all caps. Unless I'm being serious or the person I'm texting is an expressionless texter. For less laughter but still to make sure I don't sound fierce I add a 'lol' to the end. Can't deny I'm insecure, though."],["Haha It's the only way to flirt, lol.  😘😘😘😍😍😍","*djfortune 98* *1998* *the year of nineteen ninety eight*   Fuck I'm 25 and we got kids posting here now.

But sprinkling some of those in your texts does make you seem friendlier/more approachable rather than seeming monotonous and emotionless."],["For me personally:   I'm fine with haha. I think emojis can be cute if used properly. A text message in all emojis is an instant no. I dislike lol.","I always read lol as a sarcastic \"haha\""],["When i was single, I used them all the fucking time, and it's never been a problem that i know of. Sure people may make fun of me behind my back, but that's behind my back.  Text however you want, as long is authentically you and not some projected personality. It really doesn't matter in the long run."],["Well if she asks you something and you say hahahahahaha, then that's a problem :P    But if she shares a joke and you do hahahaha that's fine. Not every time though.    And if you're having a conversation with her and every alternate text is a hahahahaha, then she will think you are crazily weird or super into her. (When you like someone, everything they say seems to amuse you or something)"],["They'r fun to use and a good way to flirt with them. As long as you're not like Nicki Minaj and using 15 in a row, you should be good."],["I dislike it and I've dumped dudes over it.  Communication is important to me and if I dislike how you communicate that's a fundamental issue in my book.","Wait so do you not like the use of emojis and such at all?","I don't like the use of emojis and such by guys."],["I don't mind, as long as there bulk of the conversation is actually words. If I just get a \"paragraph\" of emojis that I then have to decipher, it's super annoying."],["I only use them with girls I like"],["I know a guy with a master's degree who publishes scholarly articles, but he writes \"haha\" at the end of every text. It is so off-putting! I know he's smarter than that!"]]}
