Also important to note that Tupac was born in NYC, grew up in Baltimore, and moved to Marin (Bay area people), before DANCING for Digital Underground before becoming ‚ÄúTupac‚Äù. Incredibly talented artist but you gotta understand the business perspective.

But I think my point still stands.","Meh... that's like saying without the first carpenter houses wouldn't have ever been built. Hiphop was gonna become a genre eventually regardless and Dre is more important than Kool.","Why do you say that? He invented the concept of break beats which is arguably the most fundamental part of hip hop. Also we seem to forget that hip hop is not Only music. It‚Äôs dance and graf too. And cool herc fostered all 3 at his parties .

There is no single most important figure in Hip-Hop.","Facts"],["He‚Äôs got an argument.  Being a part of NWA and how historically important and influential that group was, then moving to Death Row, which is also just incredible historically relevant and influential.

His solo albums the Chronic and 2001 both being legit classics.  Plus I think he deserves a ton of credit as a businessman in Hip-Hop. Everything he did with Aftermath, but even bigger now, Beats by Dre. Making a billion dollars.

Not to mention, he's got a couple of classic albums under his belt too.

You didn‚Äôt even have to mention Kendrick Lamar and Anderson Paak","As he shouldn't as both artists were established and making noise long before Dre.","Dre's first album was in print before Lamar and Paak were even born, before NWA was even a thing.  He's literally been making music longer than they have been alive.","i think they meant before their career intersected with Dre, not that they were around longer","That makes sense","Dre produced for Kendrick's real debut album GKMC, without him he would not have gotten so famous and therefore probably wouldn't have made TPAB","What songs did he produce for GKMC?

Dre (and Kanye) have always had stellar supporting casts that haven't been given the proper credit for their contributions."],["The whole \"Dre signed Em, who signed 50 who signed....\" thing always has weirded me out. Where's the posts about how important Faith Newman is for signing Nas to Colombia Records? Where are those posts about Jaz-O? Without him, do we have Jay Z, then Kanye, Cole, Rihanna and everybody that those guys put on?  Dr Dre contributed heavily to some classic albums and was fortunate enough to have some great people writing for him, I'd leave it at that.","People writing for Dre doesn‚Äôt matter, he‚Äôs not being discussed like this for his rapping.","[deleted]","Why are you being dumb man?"],["If you're talking about West Coast Hip Hop, sure. I think you could make a strong case for Dr. Dre being the most important, or at the very least, the most influential.  But the most important person in all of Hip Hop? No.  He didn't influence all of Hip Hop, nor is he responsible for every last great MC, DJ, or group that's come out and changed things. I don't even want to get into the fact that Hip Hop started on the East coast, which helped to influence and jumpstart things in other areas. Not only that, there are lots of other people we could make arguments for being influential, or being the cause for turning points in the art and business side of things. Run DMC kicked open a lot of doors for hip hop's popularity. Eric B and Rakim influenced a whole lot of the sound and lyrical quality of Hip Hop tracks, even to this day. Wu Tang (or arguably, the RZA) shook up the way record labels dealt with artists for at least a decade. KRS One is one of the few people actually trying to document and spread Hip Hop culture, and is still doing his thing: remember how big that recent battle between him and Big Daddy Kane got a while back.  It's more than just about name recognition and record sales, something that a lot of young fans seem to be caught up with. It's about what one has done to make major contributions and changes for the whole culture. This is why there are people in this thread who are saying that Kool Herc should be considered the most important, since without him, there most likely would be no Hip Hop to even have this discussion about. Honestly, if we're going to talk about importance, well, I think that should end the argument. Now, there are others who say he doesn't count, because a lot of people don't know who he is. That's got to be one of the dumbest counter arguments I've heard against considering him. One's ignorance of who he is and what he's done does not negate his importance. It's like someone who didn't go to school saying that Math isn't important because he doesn't know much about it.  It's also worth noting that we don't mix up importance with influence. Some artists have a lot of talent, style, and charisma, and those things can make them household names for decades. But there are others that have done things which have had major ramifications for the art they've contributed to, and that makes them important, even if not necessarily well known. Dr. Dre is certainly influential, nobody can deny that. But how many people here know who Large Professor is? I'm sure most young people will say he doesn't really matter here because they don't know who he is, but this is the guy who revolutionized beat making in the early 90s.  And he's also the guy who helped bring out Nas. There's a reason why other beat makers like Dj Premier and Pete Rock bring up Large Professor when they talk about their own careers, beat making in general, and and how important he is to Hip Hop as a whole. I haven't even gotten into what those two have contributed.  Of course, we could get into what one considers to be most important, or how influence and importance aren't mutually exclusive, so whoever has both going for them more than others should be considered the most important, or we could just start listing notable artists over the years and comparing notes. We could go on and on, and I'm sure everyone is going to have their own nominations. That's fine, and I think that would be all well and good. But if we're going to be talking about who's the most important... well, that's something that can only be discussed fairly if we don't come at this with just our personal tastes, and lack of knowledge of artists we haven't learned about."],["False.
