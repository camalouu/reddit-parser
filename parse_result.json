{"postContent":"I (18 INTJ) am in love with a girl (20 INFJ) at my university. I met her last September at the art club we go to every Friday evening. We connected decently well. Two weeks later, I got her number and asked her out. She said yes but cancelled at the last minute because she was facing a heavier workload than anticipated. She said that we would make it up the future, but we never did because I kept asking her each weekend, and she might have gotten annoyed. Eventually, I apologized, and she accepted with civility.  I thought she stopped liking me, so at the art club, I started getting nervous around her. I would ask her a bunch of questions to try to know more about her, but it might have come off as an interrogation since I didn't really show my emotions. This pattern continued for a long time. We stopped texting in December, and for five weeks this semester, we didn't have any contact with each other.  The week after Spring Break, we met at the art club again. We went out to eat, and she, I and three others stayed for some time in the restaurant and played cards, told riddles, etc. She seemed less nervous than usual around me, and we had a good time in the group. We live in the same dorm, so when the group dispersed, we walked through campus together, having our first ever private conversation, wherein she seemed more at ease than usual. I noticed that she mirrored one of my speech habits, which is saying that \"it's tomorrow\" after midnight.  We had two more private walks to our dorm after that, and we made friendly conversation. Nevertheless, she's still awkward and nervous-seeming around me when we're in a group.  Tomorrow, when we walk back to our dorm, I plan to tell her that even though our friendship hasn't worked out, I'm ready to give us a second chance and make certain changes so that things don't turn out the same. I hope that she will acknowledge and agree to this. Both of us take relationships very seriously and would definitely require friendship before romance.  If you have any thoughts, please share!","title":"Do I have a chance with her?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/bc8btc/do_i_have_a_chance_with_her/","comments":[["Okay so its really tough to know the full story but: I think most guys have been where you are at least once. I for sure have. Use it as a stepping stone. Its kind of a dumb urban dictionary thing, but look up \"one-itis\".  She knows that youre into her. Yet she does nothing. Think about that for a second. Either she is definately not into you in that way, or she is waaaaaaaay unsure about it. You said it was last september, thats 7 months ago... Not gonna happen.  The fact that youre still thinking about it now is a big sign that you are overthinking about this girl and need to cut it off. Its a sign of desparation and obsession and she will think the same. If shes acting weird around you when others are there, if youre having to apologize to her for asking her out, and if the texts are dead, then why do you still want to do anything with this girl? Really, why? Because youre obsessed. We have all been there, but I can guarantee you: youll get over it. Youll also be way better prepared for the next (inevitable) girl you have any type of feelings for  Id say you have two options: -forget about it, and begin the healing phase now -wait for the right moment, and hit the nuke button. Ask her out once again after a decent conversation, maybe a trip back to your dorm or whatever. Dont try and wriggle your way back, just do it. If she says no this time, you reaaaaallly have to give up completely.  Wish you the best man. Lmk how it goes whatever you decide to do"],["Infj?","The Myers-Briggs type INFJ (introverted, intuitive, feeling, judging) is what I'm referring to in case that's what you're asking. I'm INTJ—T for thinking—and supposedly, INTJ and INFJ are really compatible.  It kind of sucks that we are both really introverted, so it's often hard to make conversation. The T-F difference also might play a role in our distancing—I might tend to be less sensitive than appropriate (to the expense of my crush's feelings). This is, I believe, part of the reason we became distant in the first place. Nevertheless, I sense that we are actually really compatible in the long run, and I hope that she will understand and give us a second chance. Would you find this reasonable?"],["Yeah, you have a chance."],["I wouldn't tell her that tomorrow, its putting waaaaaaay to much pressure on just having a friendship. In all honesty she may not be interested in you from the information you gave, the INTJ and INFJ aren't actually the best indicators of compatibility. If you feel like the conversations are just friendly than they are just that. My suggestion is to continue to have casual conversations with her, and really be honest with how she is behaving in those convos. Even if someone is introverted they will want to continue talking to someone that they are interested in. If she is keeping the convo short and is not really engaged in it than she is probably not into you romantically.   My ultimate advice is that any relationship shouldnt be so much work in the beginning, you should kind of know if someone is interested in you regardless if they are introverted or not. It sounds like you've already made your attentions clear and she wasnt receptive, it's unlikely that she will change her mind."]]}
