    "post": "Whenever I'm dreaming they never feel like I'm in control and there's very little detail. It's like a foggy mess that skips constantly. I have never once remembered a dream that was anything similar to what real life looks like and I've never been present within my dream like I would be while I'm awake. I know that might not make sense but essentially I've been trying to lucid dream for 3 weeks unsuccessfully. I want to feel more present in my dreams and wake up after my dreams feeling like I did just exit them not feel like it's a distant memory. Choosing to leave after becoming lucid. My goal is to have dreams that genuinely feel real and be present and exit being aware of this realism as if I were awake.",

                "Sounds like poor recall to me.  What all did you do so far to improve your recall and induce lucid dreams?  Also, it takes most people more than 3 weeks of consistently practicing proper techniques and that negative mindset won't get you closer to your goals, but practically render them impossible.  Dreams are all about expectations so if you say you \"can't\", you in fact won't be able to",
                "i've been doing a dream journal as well as trying to hold an anchor. I've also been using a mantra throughout the day. Any other suggestions?",
                "An anchor sounds like WILD, but there's more to it. Here's a guide to make sure that you're actually practicing the technique correctly: https://www.dreamviews.com/blogs/nerefa/lunars-wild-guide-94340/",
                "For recall, I have several things you can do alongside journaling to help.  There are several things you can do to aid your dream recall in addition to dream journaling. First, review recently journaled dreams before bed. This helps you remember those dreams, find patterns in dreams, and remember more dreams. Next, also before bed, set intentions to remember your dreams when you wake up by actively deciding that you will remember your dreams when you wake up. The more important this decision is to you personally and the more you think about it, the more likely you are to remember your dreams when you wake up. There's nothing mystical about intentions, as any time we decide to do something in the future or at a later moment in time we set an intention. Finally, whenever you wake up and as quickly as possible upon waking up, do a thing we call dream delving. This involves laying in the sleeping position you woke up in and thinking about what you were last dreaming, thinking, experiencing with your senses, feeling emotionally, etc. If you cannot get anything, try to think about what you could have been dreaming about. If you get vague emotions or thoughts, try to think about why you were getting those thoughts. If you get dream scenes, work your way backwards from end to beginning to recall as much detail as possible. Once you've gotten as much as you can from one sleeping position, move to any other sleeping positions you may utilize throughout the night and repeat the procedure. This works by utilizing the mechanisms for how memory access works. First, accessing dream memories works partly off state dependent memory, so those dream memories associate with the sleeping positions you were in when you had the dreams. Second, memory itself works off association, and since the memories at the end of the dream are easiest to recall and access overall, you start with those and associate to the memories before those and so on until you've gotten as much as you can. Then you journal what you have been able to recall.",
                "thanks this is super helpful. Also in your experience when you do become lucid is the dream much more vivid. That's my main question since i'm pretty sure i haven't lucid dreamed before. All my dreams really play out like scenes and I feel like i'm just going with the flow and things are very blurry.",
                "Vividness is more a factor of qualitative dream recall, or how well you remember your dreams.  My lucid dreams have ranged from not vivid at all to hyper realistic, and everything in between.",
                "that's interesting so it really depends that's good to know thanks you!",
                "NP. Happy to help.",
                "do you remember feeling present in your dreams? Mine aren't vivid at all it feels like me but I'm not controlling what I do and it's very much just my subconscious.",
                "I'm lucid in every dream, so yes, I do. All of my decisions are conscious and I remember my dreams as vividly as I do real life (if not sometimes more)",
                "thank you for the article i'll definitely read through! I checked your AMA which was extremely interesting I hope I can one day achieve a high level of vividness and complete awareness like you do in your dreams (🤞🤣). Thanks for the help!",
                "When sleeping I always wake up at random times so it’s hard to put a timer because I might wake up before it went off but I’m able to remember the dreams I’ve had throughout the night,can I use WBTB after waking up remembering I just had a dream",
                "Most people wake up at least once a night and simply don't remember it.  As far as I'm aware, natural awakenings are perfectly fine for WBTB, but I also never practiced any techniques, so I'm not an expert there",
                "Ok also Recently when trying WBTB started noticing he signs of body falling asleep the colors you see when you close your eyes was getting more vivid,my body kept twitching,and I couldn’t feel my arms or legs but I just wasn’t able to completely fall asleep and my arm started to hurt since I sleep with my arm under my pillow so I just gave up,and when I checked my clock I was almost an hour and a half of lying there,is it normal to take that long ?",
                "That I can't answer, sorry.   All I can say is that WBTB is no technique, but an addition that can be added to any technique.  So, here's a few guides for proper techniques:  MILD: https://www.mindfulluciddreaming.com/post/mnemonic-induction-of-lucid-dreaming-mild  WILD: https://www.dreamviews.com/blogs/nerefa/lunars-wild-guide-94340/  SSILD: https://community.ld4all.com/t/ssild-2-0-tutorial/38546   Like I said, I never practiced any techniques, because I'm a natural, but I've been told that MILD is comparably easy for beginners, so I usually recommend that",

The rest are additional things. It sounds like you have poor qualitative dream recall though. What all do you do to help you remember your dreams?",
